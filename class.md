4. Creating Multiple Instances
</summary>
Problem: Create another instance of the `BakeryItem` class with a different name and price.
</details>

<summary>
5. Class Methods
</summary>
Problem: Add a method to the `BakeryItem` class that prints the name and price of the item.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
6. Calling Instance Methods
</summary>
Problem: Call the method you added in the previous step on both instances of the `BakeryItem` class to display their names and prices.
</details>

7. Class Inheritance
</summary>
Problem: Create a subclass `Pastry` that inherits from the `BakeryItem` class and has an additional property `flavor`.
